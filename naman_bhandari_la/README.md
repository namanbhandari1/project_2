# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

I was tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. My model predicts the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is a detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

I practiced the following skills in this project:

- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science
- Technologies used include: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, MatPlotLib, and various regularization models. 

### Prompt

Can we identify the metrics that help us best predict the true value of a home in Ames, IA to make good housing investments?

### Overview

This project generates regression models based on exploratory data analysis and data cleansing for a dataset of homes sold between 2006 and 2010 consisting of various features such as sq. ft. and # of bedrooms for Ames, IA. This projects depicts my ability to visualize data, conduct statistical analyses, and create advanced predictive models based upon the data to help analyze which features are most important in determining the true value of a home in Ames, IA.
